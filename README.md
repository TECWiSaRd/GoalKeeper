# GoalKeeper — AI-Powered Goal & Assignment Tracker for macOS

GoalKeeper is a macOS app that uses Claude AI to help you plan goals, track assignments, and study smarter. It features a three-column layout inspired by Apple Calendar, activity-ring progress tracking, and a built-in update system.

## Features

### Goals
- Create goals with a title, description, type, priority, and optional due date
- Attach a rubric or image for Claude to analyze
- Claude breaks your goal into 4–8 ordered steps with time estimates and tips
- Track step completion — rings update in real time
- Re-analyze any goal at any time from the toolbar

### Homework Schedule
- Import a schedule by pasting text or attaching a photo
- Claude extracts all assignments, tests, and quizzes with their due dates and subjects
- Review and edit extracted items before saving
- Items are grouped by subject in the sidebar and shown as dots on the calendar

### Study Guides
- Automatically offered for tests, quizzes, and review assignments
- Claude researches the topic and generates a full structured study guide
- Three tabs: **Study Guide** (collapsible sections + key points), **Practice** (tap-to-reveal Q&A), **Tips**
- Guides are saved and persist between sessions — regenerate anytime

### Calendar
- Apple Calendar-style month grid
- Goal dots and schedule dots shown per day
- Summary rings for overall progress across active goals

### Progress Rings
- Three concentric rings per goal (like Apple Fitness):
  - **Outer** — overall completion %
  - **Middle** — steps completed
  - **Inner** — time elapsed toward due date (turns red when overdue)

### Settings
- **API Key** — securely stored in the macOS Keychain
- **AI Model** — choose between Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus
- **Updates** — check for and install updates directly in the app

### In-App Updates
- Checks your GitHub repo for a new `version.json` on every Settings open
- Downloads and installs `GoalKeeper.zip` automatically
- Replaces the existing app in-place — no duplicates

## 🚀 Xcode Setup

### 1. Create a New Project
- Xcode → **File → New → Project → macOS → App**
- Language: **Swift**, Interface: **SwiftUI**
- Name: `GoalKeeper`

### 2. Add the Swift Files
Drag all `.swift` files into your Xcode project. When prompted, make sure **"Copy items if needed"** is checked.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `GoalPlannerApp.swift` | App entry point |
| `Models.swift` | All data models |
| `GoalStore.swift` | State + persistence |
| `AnthropicService.swift` | Claude API calls |
| `KeychainService.swift` | Secure API key + model preference storage |
| `ProgressRingView.swift` | Activity ring components |
| `ContentView.swift` | 3-column `NavigationSplitView` root |
| `SidebarView.swift` | Left column — goals + grouped schedule |
| `CalendarDashboardView.swift` | Middle column — calendar + rings |
| `GoalDetailView.swift` | Right column — goal steps + AI summary |
| `ScheduleDetailView.swift` | Right column — assignment detail + upcoming |
| `StudyGuideView.swift` | Study guide sheet with tabs |
| `AddGoalView.swift` | New goal sheet |
| `ImportScheduleView.swift` | Schedule import sheet |
| `SettingsView.swift` | API key, model picker, update checker |
| `UpdateService.swift` | GitHub update checker + ZIP installer |
| `Contents.json` | App logos |

> Delete the auto-generated `ContentView.swift` and `Item.swift` that Xcode creates.

### 3. Set Your API Key (at runtime)
Launch the app → **GoalKeeper → Settings (⌘,)** → paste your Anthropic API key.

Get a free key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). New accounts receive $5 in free credits.

### 4. Configure the Update URL
In `UpdateService.swift`, replace the placeholder with your GitHub raw URL:
```swift
static let manifestURL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GoalKeeper/main/version.json"
```

### 5. App Sandbox
Target → **Signing & Capabilities** → remove **App Sandbox** (required for the in-app update installer to replace the app binary).

### 6. Set Minimum Deployment Target
Target → **General** → Minimum Deployments → **macOS 14.0**

### 7. Build & Run
Select **My Mac** and press ▶.

## 🔑 API Key & Cost

GoalKeeper uses the Anthropic Claude API. Each user enters their own key in Settings — keys are stored in the macOS Keychain, never hardcoded.

**Approximate cost per request:**

| Model | Cost per analysis |
|---|---|
| Haiku (recommended) | ~$0.01 |
| Sonnet | ~$0.03–0.05 |
| Opus | ~$0.05–0.10 |

Study guides use more tokens (~4,000 max) so cost slightly more than goal analyses.

## 📦 Releasing Updates

1. Bump **Version** in Xcode → General (e.g. `1.0.1`)
2. Bump **Build** by 1
3. **⇧⌘K** clean → **Product → Archive → Custom → Copy App → Sign to Run Locally → Export**
4. In Terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/GoalKeeper
zip -r GoalKeeper.zip GoalKeeper.app
ls -lh GoalKeeper.zip  # confirm several MB
```
5. On GitHub, create a new Release with the version as the tag and upload `GoalKeeper.zip`
6. Edit `version.json` in your repo:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GoalKeeper/releases/download/1.0.1/GoalKeeper.zip",
  "notes": "What changed in this version."
}
```

Users will see the update next time they open Settings (⌘,).
